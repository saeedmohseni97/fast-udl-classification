## üß† Overview

This repository contains the code for a novel classification algorithm based on **undercomplete dictionary learning (UDL)**.  
Unlike conventional sparse methods using overcomplete dictionaries, this method:

- Learns **one undercomplete dictionary per class** using SVD and gradient projection
- Classifies by **minimum reconstruction error**
- Achieves **high accuracy** with **low computational cost**

---

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset is a **preprocessed MNIST** dataset:

- Training and testing images and their corresponding labels are saved in their own `.mat` file
- Each image is flattened into a vector
- Files can be loaded directly in MATLAB or Python

Place downloaded `.mat` files in the `MNIST_Dataset/` directory.

## üîß Requirements

- MATLAB R2018b or newer
- No extra toolboxes needed
